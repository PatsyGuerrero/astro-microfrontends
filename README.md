# astro-microfrontends

This demo takes advantage of EcmaScript Modules (ESM) and url-imports to do client-side composition of microfrontends. Express is used for serving assets, but ideally one would have a dedicated CDN hosting them.

## Features

- âœ¨ Client-side composition of microfrontends
- ðŸ“¦ Multiframeworks with Astro Islands
- ðŸš€ SSG/SSR supported by Astro

## Usage

- Build each microfrontend with `npm run build`
- Start each microfrontend with `node server.js`
- Build the shell with `npm run build`
- Start the shell with `npm run preview`

## Shared dependencies

Dependencies such as react and react-dom are shared across applications. They are fetched from [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) and gets cached in the browser, reducing the bundle size. Each app can share other dependencies as well through url imports.
